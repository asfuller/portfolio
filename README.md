# Contacts CRUD
I practiced the skills learned to create Contact CRUD, a Full Stack web application using Flask,
Python, and React. It was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/PppslXOR7TA?si=a5qz--5mRs-qEA7m).

I am practicing automation and sharpening my skills in Full Stack Development while expanding my
knowledge of different stacks.
